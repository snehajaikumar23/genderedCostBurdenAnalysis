# Introduction


  Our motivation to choose this topic came from personal observations and the ideas discussed in the book, "Invisible Women: Exploring Data Bias in a World Designed for Men." In the book, the author, Caroline Criado Perez, uses data analysis to prove how women are affected by the patriarchy on a deeper level, how the "default male" property of the patriarchy has led to data gaps in centuries old data consequently leading to male oriented findings which are also treated as the basis for the female population. These gaps have tangible economic consequences. Women often face higher financial burdens in everyday life, from menstrual hygiene and maternity products to gender-priced essentials like razors, deodorants, and clothing that cost more despite being nearly identical to men’s versions. They also encounter hidden costs, such as paying more for safe transportation, workplace appearance expectations, or products redesigned to fit male-based standards. Healthcare adds another layer of disparity, as women frequently pay more out-of-pocket when medical systems and diagnostic tools are not designed with them in mind. These patterns motivated us to analyze large-scale U.S. datasets to quantify how these financial burdens actually differ by gender across both everyday spending and healthcare.
