    "title": "Quantifying Gendered Cost Burdens in Everyday Spending and Healthcare - Going Beyond the Pink Tax",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nOur motivation to choose this topic came from personal observations and the ideas discussed in the book, “Invisible Women: Exploring Data Bias in a World Designed for Men.” In the book, the author, Caroline Criado Perez, uses data analysis to prove how women are affected by the patriarchy on a deeper level, how the “default male” property of the patriarchy has led to data gaps in centuries old data consequently leading to male oriented findings which are also treated as the basis for the female population. These gaps have tangible economic consequences. Women often face higher financial burdens in everyday life, from menstrual hygiene and maternity products to gender-priced essentials like razors, deodorants, and clothing that cost more despite being nearly identical to men’s versions. They also encounter hidden costs, such as paying more for safe transportation, workplace appearance expectations, or products redesigned to fit male-based standards. Healthcare adds another layer of disparity, as women frequently pay more out-of-pocket when medical systems and diagnostic tools are not designed with them in mind. These patterns motivated us to analyze large-scale U.S. datasets to quantify how these financial burdens actually differ by gender across both everyday spending and healthcare.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\n2.1 Technical description\nIdentify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)\nhttps://www.bls.gov/cex/tables/cross-tab/mean.htm#cu-singlesbyage The U.S. Census Bureau collects consumer expenditure data on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) every year.\nWe chose to focus specifically on data for male and female singles grouped by age of reference. Our data includes ~200 expenditure categories (ranging from essential to discretionary expenses) x age groups (7 columns). Each dataset displayed this information for a particular gender for a particular year. In total we had 22 datasets spanning from 2009-2019 for male and females. We specifically chose this time range as it was between the Great Recession and COVID-19, two events that play a strong influence on consumer spending and financial stability.\nOne challenge we encountered was due to the nature of the data. Some table cells were marked with codes (i.e., a, b, c- representing no data reported, too small to display, or large sampling errors). Codes a and b were treated as missing values in the analysis. We retained the values for code c in our analysis to preserve as much information as possible, while acknowledging that estimates for these cases may be less precise. While this allowed us to maintain consistency, it also highlighted that some subgroups may have less reliable or incomplete data, and caution should be used when interpreting results for these cases.\nhttps://forms.gle/TSWnHfM7nQpimnQ59 We also conducted a brief qualitative and quantitative survey of 31 students in our Data Science masters program to get a better sense of lifestyle patterns among young adults with various levels of income who live in a city with a high cost of living.\nhttps://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/age-and-sex We downloaded the Age and Sex tables from this website and used Table 7 (total health spending per capita) and Table 7-1 (out of pocket spending per-capita). Table 7 had 28 rows and 20 columns. We used data from row 13 till 28, column 1 to column 11, which covered values for males and females. The data was further cleaned to remove repeating age groups i.e., the rows for age groups 19-64, 65+ were not used as they were included on other breakdowns. The same format was used for table 7-1.\nhttps://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html We filled the form on the website to request two CSVs of birth count data by age group for year 2003 - 2006 and 2007 - 2024. The csvs have “Notes”,“Age of Mother 9”,“Age of Mother 9 Code”, and “Births” columns. Then, I merged the data in R to form a dataframe “births_raw,” with 4 columns and 61 rows.\nCode\n# Load in all 22 datasets for single females and males from 2009-2019\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#install.packages(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(readxl)\n# install.packages(\"janitor\")\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(\"datasets/c\", pattern = \"*.xlsx\", full.names = TRUE)\nmanual_header &lt;- c(\n  \"Item\",\n  \"All\",\n  \"Under 25 years\",\n  \"25-34 years\",\n  \"35-44 years\",\n  \"45-54 years\",\n  \"55-64 years\",\n  \"65 years and older\"\n)\n\nclean_numeric &lt;- function(x) {\n  x |&gt;\n    str_replace(\"^[abc]/\\\\s*\", \"\") |&gt;   # remove a/, b/, c/ and any space after\n    na_if(\"\") |&gt;                       # empty string → NA\n    as.numeric()\n}\n\n\nread_cex_file &lt;- function(filepath) {\n\n  gender &lt;- if (str_detect(filepath, \"females\")) \"Female\" else \"Male\"\n  year   &lt;- str_extract(filepath, \"\\\\d{4}\") |&gt; as.numeric()\n\n  raw &lt;- read_excel(filepath, col_names = FALSE)\n\n\n  names(raw) &lt;- manual_header\n\n  # Add metadata\n   df &lt;- raw |&gt;\n      slice(47:229) |&gt;       \n      janitor::remove_empty(\"cols\") |&gt;\n      filter(!(Item != \"\" & if_all(-Item, is.na))) |&gt; filter(Item != \"Average annual expenditures\")\n   \n   gift_start &lt;- which(df$Item %in% c(\"Gifts of goods and services\",\n                                   \"Gifts of goods and services, total\"))\n   gift_end   &lt;- which(df$Item == \"All other gifts\")\n   \n   \n\n  if (length(gift_start) == 1 && length(gift_end) == 1) {\n    df &lt;- df[-(gift_start:gift_end), ]\n  }\n   \n    df &lt;- df |&gt; mutate(\n        gender = gender,\n        year = year\n      ) |&gt;\n     mutate(across(-c(Item, gender, year), clean_numeric)) \n  \n\n  return(df)\n}\n\ndf_main &lt;- map_df(files, read_cex_file)\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\ndf_long &lt;- df_main |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(Item, gender, year),  \n    names_to = \"age_group\",\n    values_to = \"expenditure\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    age_group = factor(\n      age_group,\n      levels = c(\n        \"All\",\n        \"Under 25 years\",\n        \"25-34 years\",\n        \"35-44 years\",\n        \"45-54 years\",\n        \"55-64 years\",\n        \"65 years and older\"\n      ),\n      ordered = TRUE\n    )\n  )\n\ndf_missing &lt;- df_long",

Older adults, particularly women, may be less likely to purchase additional vehicles, so fewer survey respondents fall into this category. Small sample sizes could have led to more missing values. This could also imply that certain expenditure categories may be more relevant to men than women .In general, females had more missing values than males, and under 25 years consistently had more missing values across items. Young adults often have smaller or more variable spending patterns, live with parents, or have irregular incomes, which can make data harder to collect reliably. The trend of seeing more missing values among females and among young adults was confirmed in our last heatmap, as we see most missing values among female young adults.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_heat, aes(x = age_group, y = gender, fill = n_missing)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"#deebf7\",  \n    high = \"#08306b\",\n    name = \"Missing Count\"\n  )  +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Missing Values by Age Group and Gender\",\n    x = \"Age Group\",\n    y = \"Gender\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))",

To help us understand this, we use the Out-of-pocket spending data from the same website.\nWe used a line chart to plot the spending gap (Female − Male per-capita out-of-pocket spending), which showed all the values were positive. Upon hovering over the line, we could also see the exact amount difference that year. Except for the age group 0-18, which mostly includes children dependent on parents/guardians, the graphs showed positive lines for all age groups. The values fluctuate throughout the span of 18 years, but never go below zero, which means there has been a healthcare cost burden on women for a long period of time.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# ---------- READ TABLE 7-1 ---------- \n\ndf71 &lt;- read_excel(file_path, \n                   sheet = \"Table 7-1\", skip = 3) \n\n# KEEP ONLY LEVELS (dollars) COLUMNS \n\ndf71 &lt;- df71[, 1:11] \n\nnames(df71)[1] &lt;- \"AgeGroup\" \n\n# FIX numeric columns \ndf71[2:11] &lt;- lapply(df71[2:11], \n          function(x) as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", x))) \n\n# ---------- EXTRACT BLOCKS ---------- \n\nmale_start71 &lt;- which(df71$AgeGroup == \"Males\")\nfemale_start71 &lt;- which(df71$AgeGroup == \"Females\")\nmale_block71 &lt;- df71[(male_start71+1):(male_start71+7), ] \nfemale_block71 &lt;- df71[(female_start71+1):(female_start71+7), ] \n\n# ---------- CLEAN DATA ---------- \n\nmale_clean71 &lt;- male_block71 |&gt; \n  filter(AgeGroup %in% target_groups) \n\nfemale_clean71 &lt;- female_block71 |&gt; \n  filter(AgeGroup %in% target_groups)\n\nmale_clean71$AgeGroup &lt;- factor(male_clean71$AgeGroup, \n                                levels = target_groups) \n\nfemale_clean71$AgeGroup &lt;- factor(female_clean71$AgeGroup, \n                                  levels = target_groups) \n\n# ---------- LONG FORMAT ---------- \n\nmale_long71 &lt;- male_clean71 |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(all_of(years), \n               names_to = \"Year\", \n               values_to = \"Male\") \n\nfemale_long71 &lt;- female_clean71 |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(all_of(years), \n               names_to = \"Year\", \n               values_to = \"Female\") \n\ndf_long71 &lt;- male_long71 |&gt; \n  left_join(female_long71, by = c(\"AgeGroup\",\"Year\")) |&gt; \n  mutate( Year = as.integer(Year), Gap = Female - Male ) \n\nlibrary(plotly)\n# ===============================\n# 1.

The dots representing average female spending are ahead of those for average male spending across all age groups over the 18-year span, which tells us that women have had to spend more out of pocket over the years.\n\n\nCode\n# ---------- AVERAGE SPENDING ---------- \n\ndf_avg71 &lt;- df_long71 |&gt; \n  group_by(AgeGroup) |&gt; \n  summarise( AvgMale = mean(Male, na.rm = TRUE), \n             AvgFemale = mean(Female, na.rm = TRUE) )\n\n# Create long format with Sex column for easy legend\ndf_avg71_long &lt;- df_avg71 |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(AvgMale, AvgFemale),\n    names_to = \"Sex\",\n    values_to = \"AvgSpend\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Sex = recode(Sex,\n                 \"AvgMale\" = \"Male\",\n                 \"AvgFemale\" = \"Female\")\n  )\n\nggplot(df_avg71_long, aes(y = AgeGroup, x = AvgSpend, color = Sex)) +\n\n  # Dumbbell connecting segment\n  geom_segment(\n    data = df_avg71,\n    aes(x = AvgMale, xend = AvgFemale,\n        y = AgeGroup, yend = AgeGroup),\n    color = \"gray70\", linewidth = 2\n  ) +\n\n  # Points for each sex\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n\n  # Nice legend colors\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Male\" = \"#3182bd\", \"Female\" = \"#cb181d\"),\n    name = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average per-capita out-of-pocket spending, 2002–2020\",\n    subtitle = \"Women Consistently Pay More Out-of-Pocket at Every Age\",\n    x = \"Average Spending (USD)\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.line.x = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed a pattern in the spending gap in all the graphs; it was the highest in the age group 85+ and the second highest in the age group 19-44.\nFor the age group 85+, we noticed the spending gap is extreme. This could be because of the higher life expectancy of women as compared to men. (Zarulli V et al, 2018). Even though this is a per-capita data, we think the men who exist in this dataset show “survival bias,” which means because women live longer, the men who survived for this age group are already healthy or need less medical support.\nThe other age group that showed a high spending gap was 19-44, which made us question whether the 19-44 gap had something to do with the “biological clock” and the evolutionary expectation from women to reproduce. With the help of CDC’s Natality data, we were able to visualize that most women give birth between the ages of 20 and 34, while the age groups 15-19 and 40-44 show significant birth counts. This age range is consistent with the 19-44 category we see in both out-of-pocket and total health care spending graphs, where the spending gap is high.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nb1 &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/Natality_2003_2006.csv\")\nb2 &lt;- read_csv(\"datasets/Natality_2007_2024.csv\")\n\nbirths_raw &lt;- bind_rows(b1, b2)\n\n#cleaning\nbirths_clean &lt;- births_raw |&gt;\n  select(Age = `Age of Mother 9`, Births) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Age), Age != \"Total\") |&gt;\n  \n  # CLEAN & SHORTEN AGE LABELS\n  mutate(\n    Age = trimws(Age),\n    Age = recode(Age,\n      \"Under 15 years\"      = \"&lt;15\",\n      \"15-19 years\"         = \"15-19\",\n      \"20-24 years\"         = \"20-24\",\n      \"25-29 years\"         = \"25-29\",\n      \"30-34 years\"         = \"30-34\",\n      \"35-39 years\"         = \"35-39\",\n      \"40-44 years\"         = \"40-44\",\n      \"45-49 years\"         = \"45-49\",\n      \"50 years and over\"   = \"50&lt;\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(Age) |&gt;\n  summarise(Births = sum(Births, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Age = factor(\n      Age,\n      levels = c(\"&lt;15\",\"15-19\",\"20-24\",\"25-29\",\"30-34\",\n                 \"35-39\",\"40-44\",\"45-49\",\"50&lt;\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\nggplot(births_clean, aes(x = Age, y = Births)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkgreen\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x / 1e6, \"M\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"U.S. Birth Counts by Maternal Age (2003–2024)\",\n    x = \"Maternal Age Group\",\n    y = \"Total Births\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further analyse the cost burden on women, we decided to see if it holds true for a small dataset. We wanted to see if there is a gendered cost burden midst people in similar situations. In our case, it was the fall 2025 cohort of data science graduate students at columbia university.

We also see that there is more variability in rent for females compared to males. These extra outliers in the $2,500-3,000 range suggest that more women may be incentivized to spend extra on rent if it means prioritizing safety. We will take a look at this more in the next plot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Compute average priority rank for each gender + factor\ndf_bump &lt;- df_rank_long |&gt;\n  group_by(gender, factor) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_rank = mean(rank, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(gender) |&gt;\n  mutate(priority = rank(mean_rank, ties.method = \"first\")) |&gt;  # 1 = highest priority\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(df_bump, aes(x = gender, y = priority, group = factor, color = factor)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.3) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = 1:6) +   # 1 at top\n  labs(\n    title = \"Priority Ranking of Housing Factors by Gender\",\n    subtitle = \"1 = highest priority • 6 = lowest priority\",\n    x = \"Gender\",\n    y = \"Priority Rank\",\n    color = \"Housing Factor\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen valuing proximity to campus and neighborhood safety aligns with higher rents. Women may prioritize being closer to school or in safer neighborhoods, even if it’s more expensive, which explains the observed high outliers.\nSurprisingly, building security was ranked higher among men. Women may consider neighborhood safety more important than the building’s security features (cameras, doormen), whereas men might feel neighborhood safety is less critical and focus more on tangible security measures.\n\n4.1.1 Reference\nZarulli V, Barthold Jones J, Oksuzyan A, et al. Women live longer than men even during severe famines and epidemics.

    "text": "We wanted to analyse the spending gap by gender and most of the findings aligned with our expectations. However some results were unexpected for example, men spending more on transportation. We were later able to see that the spending habit of men aligned more with their preferences rather than biological or societal expectaions. Another unexpected observation was the extreme spending gap for age group 85+, we used existing research to reason that it could be due to women’s longer life expectancy. While the spending gaps for other categories were not as high as we expected, they existed for all age groups in out-of-pocket data. In general, we observed the main trend for uncontrollable categories like healthcare has mostly been women having to spend more than men throughout the years after the age of 18. A limitation for our project was that a lot of our datasets use survey data which could be very subjective and leaves space for human error. Further, for the survey we did in-class, we did not have enough responses to have strong results to analyse. In future, we could explore the gender based cost burdens more in depth and include factors like race, income, etc., to view more patterns. Lastly, about data analysis, we learned that data preprocessing and cleaning is a very crucial process and shouldnt be overlooked.",
