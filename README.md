### Update README (GitHub or RStudio)
Our motivation for this project was inspired by personal observations and themes from Caroline Criado Perez’s Invisible Women, which highlights how longstanding data gaps rooted in a “default male” perspective create real economic disadvantages for women. These gaps contribute to higher everyday costs for women, from gender-priced products to safety-related expenses and greater out-of-pocket healthcare spending. Motivated by these patterns, we examined large-scale U.S. datasets to quantify how cost burdens differ by gender across daily expenditures and healthcare.
